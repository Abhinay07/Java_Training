Variables are containers for storing data values.

String - stores text, such as "Hello","Abhinay","HYDERABAD". String values are surrounded by double quotes
int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
float - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99 0.845855
char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
boolean - stores values with two states: true or false

byte	1 byte	Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127
short	2 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
int	4 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
long	8 bytes	Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
float	4 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits 785.8569
double	8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits 123456789012345
boolean	1 bit	Stores true or false values
char	2 bytes	Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values


Operators

+	Addition	Adds together two values	x + y 7+2 =9
-	Subtraction	Subtracts one value from another	x - y 7-2 = 5
*	Multiplication	Multiplies two values	x * y 7*2 = 14
/	Division	Divides one value by another	x / y 7/2 = 3
%	Modulus	Returns the division remainder	x % y 7/%2 = 5
++	Increment	Increases the value of a variable by 1	++x
--	Decrement	Decreases the value of a variable by 1	--x

=	x = 5	x = 5
+=	x += 3	x = x + 3
-=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
*=	x *= 3	x = x * 3
/=	x /= 3	x = x / 3
%=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
&=	x &= 3	x = x & 3
|=	x |= 3	x = x | 3
^=	x ^= 3	x = x ^ 3
>>=	x >>= 3	x = x >> 3
<<=	x <<= 3	x = x << 3


==	Equal to	x == y
!=	Not equal	x != y
>	Greater than	x > y
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y

&& 	Logical and	Returns true if both statements are true	x < 5 &&  x < 10
|| 	Logical or	Returns true if one of the statements is true	x < 5 || x < 4
!	Logical not	Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true	!(x < 5 && x < 10)
